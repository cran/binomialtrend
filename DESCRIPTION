Description: Detection of a statistically significant trend in the data provided by the user.
    This is based on the a signed test based on the binomial distribution.
    The package returns a trend test value, T, and also a p-value. A T value 
    close to 1 indicates a rising trend, whereas a T value close to -1 indicates a decreasing
    trend. A T value close to 0 indicates no trend. There is also a command to visualize
    the trend. A test data set called gtsa_data is also available, which has global mean 
    temperatures for January, April, July, and October for the years 1851 to 2022.
